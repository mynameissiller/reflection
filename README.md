I did not know that coding would be this dificult. It is the real web and I have learned that this week!
I think that coding is very wierd, fun and complex. But that is in its own way. Coding isnt for everyone but you can make it if you try. That is why coding is very special and fun to most of the users on Putty.

What I have learned this week was how to use xml and how to code in it. I have also learned that there are no rules in xml so it makes it easier to code and make stuff such as websites that say " hello my name is Siller" like we did in this weeks lesson. Thank you Mr. Gold for teaching me xml.

I have learned how to do many things this week. The best thing I have learned this week is how to build a website
with html. I learned how to align the wording to make it neat, I also have learned how to put a submit button at the bottom along with the rest of the circle boxes and the square boxes. My favorite thing I have done all week was this website project but it was also hard so it was difficult somethimes. 
I loved putting the picture of the toppings on like pepperoni,bannana peppers,mushrooms ect.
