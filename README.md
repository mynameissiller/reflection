I did not know that coding would be this dificult. It is the real web and I have learned that this week!
I think that coding is very wierd, fun and complex. But that is in its own way. Coding isnt for everyone but you can make it if you try. That is why coding is very special and fun to most of the users on Putty.

What I have learned this week was how to use xml and how to code in it. I have also learned that there are no rules in xml so it makes it easier to code and make stuff such as websites that say " hello my name is Siller" like we did in this weeks lesson. Thank you Mr. Gold for teaching me xml.

# End Of Sixth Week
## 10/13/2017
I have learned how to do many things this week. The best thing I have learned this week is how to build a website
with html. I learned how to align the wording to make it neat, I also have learned how to put a submit button at the bottom along with the rest of the circle boxes and the square boxes. My favorite thing I have done all week was this website project but it was also hard so it was difficult somethimes. 
I loved putting the picture of the toppings on like pepperoni,bannana peppers,mushrooms ect. 

# End of Seventh Week
## 10/27/2017
This week I have learned the importance of spelling, paitence,and perfection needed to make a good website.
It includes these because for paitence you have to take time with work or there WILL be mistakes. Also
for spelling if your code isnt spelled right you will have to take more time finding out what you did wrong, that
also goes well with paitence. Finally perfection with this (perfection) can help your grade spiral up quickly
making your school life happy, your parents happy, and most importantly you happy. My favorite part of this week
how we could use websites such as W3 Schools to help us find new codes that we could use and remember in our next website.
These reasons that I have listed above are great in my opinon because spelling, paitence,and perfection is needed to make a 100%
A website.
